Project Description!   |
-------------------------
Phone Class:
------------

in this class what we have done is, we have declared 2 variables 'cont_name','cont_numb' to store 
contact name & contact number, then define 2 constructors (default,parameterized), then added getters & setters 
to get & set these value(cont_name,cont_numb), other then this we have added a toString Method to get all contacts
data & display them to user in a proper manner.

Phone_Functions Class:
----------------------

in this class what we have done is created  an ArrayList of Phone class, then created 6 functions (addcontact, 
removecontact, printAllContacts, serachcontact, sortContacts, UpdatEContact) in addcontact function what we have
done is we take name,number from user then add them in as Phone object in Phone object's ArrayList using .add 
method, in delete function we take name from user, match from our data stored in arraylist using search method,
then delete that contact details, in update function we follow the same method, take name from user for we he 
wants to update, search that name's data from arraylist & take new number/updated number from user & update that
contact details. then in printAllContact function we gave called toString method in Phone class & display all 
recrds stored in ArrayList, & sortContact function we created for sorting all records in alphabetic order.

PhoneBook Class:
----------------

this is our main class where we have displayed the Menu to user, use Do/while loop to keep on asking from user to
choose different options & test the program, we use If else statement for this purpose like if user's choice is 1
we call addContact method, if user's choice is 2 we cal searchcontact method & so on.....
when user enter 7 we have added the condition that: while loop ends & user quits the program
